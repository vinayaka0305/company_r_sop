What is AlertOps?
AlertOps is a tool we use to get alerts when something might be wrong at one of our solar sites.

It brings together alerts from different monitoring systems (called DAS) and shows them to us in one place — on the AlertOps website, by email, text messages, and the phone app (for iPhone/Android).

What Should You Do?

->Keep AlertOps open on your screen.

->Check it in the morning (including alerts from overnight).

->Keep checking it throughout the day for new alarms.

Where Do the Alarms Come From?

AlertOps receives alarms from different places:

1. DAS Alarms
These are alarms set up in the DAS systems (the systems at the sites). They warn us about:

->No power being produced (zero generation)

->Low performance

->Communication problems

->Equipment issues (like hardware faults)

If you get one of these alarms, you should open the DAS system and check if there's a real problem.

2. Email Forwarding:
Some alarms come through emails that are automatically forwarded to AlertOps.

3. iAlert:
This is another way some systems send alarms into AlertOps.

So basically, AlertOps is our alarm center — and your job is to watch it regularly and follow up on anything that looks like an issue.


DAS = Data Acquisition System
In simple terms, a DAS is the system that collects data from the solar site. It watches things like:

->How much energy the solar site is producing

->If equipment is working properly

->If there's any communication issue (like the system not reporting data)

You can think of DAS like a "security camera," but instead of watching video, it watches site performance and equipment health 24/7.

The DAS sends alerts to tools like AlertOps when something seems wrong — like if power drops to zero, an inverter stops working, or the system goes quiet.

Some common DAS platforms include AlsoEnergy, PowerTrack, Fronius, and others.
