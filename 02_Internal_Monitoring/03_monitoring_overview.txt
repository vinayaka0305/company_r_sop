Radian is a Secondary Monitor.

That means weâ€™re like a backup checker.

ðŸ”§ The Primary Monitor (usually the O&M provider) is the main team in charge. Theyâ€™re supposed to:

* Catch any issues

* Create tickets

* Fix things quickly (based on the contract)

* Help with remote troubleshooting

-> As the Secondary Monitor, our job is to:

* Double-check everything

* Make sure all problems are getting caught and ticketed

* Make sure the Primary Monitor is doing their job on time

âœ… So basically, we watch both the sites and the Primary Monitor to make sure everything runs smoothly.
