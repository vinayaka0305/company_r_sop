Monitoring Tools – Simple Overview

At Radian, we use different tools to check if the solar sites and equipment are working properly or if there are any issues like no power, no data, or low performance.

Here are the main tools we use every day or week:

->Lens – Our main platform to see site data and create tickets.

->DAS (Data Acquisition Systems) – These are systems at each site that collect and send data from the equipment.

->Redash Analytics – We use this to look at graphs and data trends to spot problems.

->AlertOps – Sends us alerts when something might be wrong.

->Google Earth – We use this to check for storms or hurricanes that might affect our sites.
