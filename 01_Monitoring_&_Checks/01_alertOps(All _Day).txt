What is AlertOps?
It's a tool (like a website) your team uses to keep track of any problems or alarms from your solar systems or related equipment.

What do you need to do?

1.Go to AlertOps:
   - Open a link provided by company

2. Set the Filters:
   - At the top of the page:
     - Change Alert Type to ALL
     - Change Time Period to Last 7 Days
     - The system should automatically show only Open alerts (these are problems that are still happening or not fixed yet)

3. Make It Easier to View:
   - Scroll down to the bottom of the page.
   - Change the Rows per page setting to 100 — this helps you see more alerts on one page and makes it quicker to manage them.

What to do with the alerts?

4. Check for Open Alerts:
   - Look for alerts from the past 7 days — this helps you catch any issues that happened overnight or earlier in the week.

5. Investigate the Alerts:
   - Find out what caused the alert.
   - If it’s something that needs a ticket (a request for action or fix), create that ticket.

6. Close the Alert:
   - After you've made the ticket (if needed), go back to AlertOps and close the alert — this shows that it's been handled.

7. Keep an Eye on AlertOps During the Day:
   - Keep AlertOps open on your screen.
   - Check it now and then to catch any new alerts that pop up.
   - Handle them the same way — investigate, make a ticket if needed, and close the alert.
