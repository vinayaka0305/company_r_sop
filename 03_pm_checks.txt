What Youre Doing in PM Checks:

Youre checking different solar sites using links (mostly to dashboards) to see if everything is working. If there's a problem, you may need to create a ticket or notify a team — depending on what the issue is.


✅ What to Check (and What to Do)

1. Use the Dashboard Links:

All the links listed (like Central 40, Luciana, Phoenix, etc.) are dashboards for different solar farms. You'll:

->Click the link

->Look at inverter data (this shows whether the system is producing power)

->Compare yesterday to today

->Look for full site outages (everything is offline) or late starts (power didn't start before 9:00 AM)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When to Create a Ticket:

✅ Create a ticket if:

The entire site is offline

The whole site started late (after 9:00 AM)

🚫 Don't create a ticket for:

A group of inverters (like a transformer) being offline — just notify the Mitchell team on Slack

Issues that fix themselves the same day

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fronius Sites (Special Rule):

These specific sites need special attention:

Burgaw, Ennis, Traveller, Little Mountain, Pecan Grove, Suncaster, Catherine Lake, Swansboro

For these sites, only ticket full site outages or full site late starts

If just one inverter is out, no ticket needed

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PowerFactors Sites:

Check these projects:

Olympos – Lane II, Tate, Eagle, Willard, Benson, Pilot Mountain

CCR Smart (Hawk) – Fairhaven E, Charlemont A

Osprey – Town of Amherst Solar, Huxley, Beacon

If a critical issue shows up but no email or DEPCOM ticket is made:

Follow the email steps in the Outage Notification Procedures


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Site Instructions:

Harts Mill, BT Kellam, Concho Valley, Corazon, Spofford (Boxford), etc. – Just click the links and check that inverters are online

For Spofford: go to the “Detailed Analytics” tab and make sure no zones are offline

Brazoria: has 4 different feeders. Check each one using the links

Revolution: check the Monitoring Inbox (you should have access to this or a guide in the procedures)
