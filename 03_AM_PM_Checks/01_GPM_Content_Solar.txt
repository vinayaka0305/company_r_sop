What You Need to Do:

1. Go to this website:
   [https://gpmportal.greenpowermonitor.com/application//portfolio/dashboard]

2. Click on "Content Solar".

3. Go to "Custom Queries".

4. Click on "Monitoring Inverters".
   (Look for a small green graph icon on the right and click it.)

5. Switch the view to "Table":
   In the top-right corner of the chart, click “Table”.

6. Open the data fully:
   Expand the table to see all devices.

7. Check if each device has data.
   If some devices have no data or data has stopped for a long time, that may be a problem.


 What to Report:

* If an inverter has stopped working for a long time, send a message to the content\_jamaica channel on Slack.

* Do NOT send a message for:

  * Inverters that started late but are now working.
  * Inverters that stopped and then fixed themselves on the same day.
