✅When to Make a Ticket:

1. Full Site Outage

   * If the whole site is down, make a ticket right away.

2. Full Inverter Outage (1 hour or more)

   * If one inverter is completely down (no production and no communication) for at least 1 hour, make a ticket.
   * If the inverter is still offline now, you can go ahead and make the ticket.

3. Intermittent Inverter Outages

   * If an inverter goes offline, comes back online, and then goes offline again within 2 days,
     → Make one intermittent outage ticket.
     → Leave it open to cover any future issues with that same inverter.
     → Don’t make a new ticket each time it happens.

 ❌ When NOT to Make a Ticket:

* If an inverter outage lasted less than 1 hour and is already over, do not make a ticket.
* If an inverter starts producing before 9:00 AM, even if it started late, do not make a ticket.
* If an inverter is producing less power than usual (derate), do not make a ticket.

 🚫 Other Rules to Remember:

* Do not use "Generic Inverter Asset" when making a ticket.
  → Always choose the specific inverter having the problem.
* If the same inverter keeps having issues over several days, just keep using the same intermittent outage ticket. No need to make new ones each time.
