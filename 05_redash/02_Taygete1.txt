When to Make Tickets:

1. Full Site Outages

   * If the entire site goes down, always make a ticket.

2. Inverter Outages (1 hour or longer)

   * If one inverter (not the whole site) is completely down (no power and no communication) for 1 hour or more, make a ticket.
   * If it is still down now, make the ticket right away.

3. Short Inverter Outages (less than 1 hour)

   * If an inverter was down but came back within an hour, do not make a ticket.

 Special Cases:

4. Late Starts

   * If an inverter starts working before 9:00 AM, do not ticket it, even if it started later than usual.

5. Derates (low power output)

   * If an inverter is producing less power than normal (a derate), do not make a ticket.

6. Intermittent Outages

   * If an inverter goes offline, comes back, and goes offline again within 2 days,
     → Create one "intermittent outage" ticket and keep it open.
     → Do not create a new ticket for each drop.

 Important Notes:

* Do not use "Generic Inverter Asset" when making tickets.
  → Always select the specific inverter having the issue.

* If the same inverter keeps having problems over several days,
  → Use the intermittent outage ticket you already made — no need to make new ones.
