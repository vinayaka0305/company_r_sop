⚠️ AlertOps – Known Issues  
These alerts still need to be monitored for anything new, but most are already ticketed or known, so usually no need to ticket again unless something *new or different shows up.

"Comms" = short for communications.

It means how devices (like inverters, meters, gateways) send data to the monitoring system.

If there’s a comms issue, it means the system can’t see or talk to that device properly.

🔁 What are "recurring comms"?
"Recurring" = happening again and again.

So, recurring comms = the device keeps losing connection over and over — but it usually comes back online by itself.

These are known issues and already being tracked, so no need to ticket again unless something new happens.
